#PhpStorm Images
This repository is to document the Dockerfiles used to create the images which support the 
[travis-phpstorm-inspector](https://github.com/dan-mathews/travis-phpstorm-inspector) project.  
The built images are in [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/danmathews1).

The naming convention for the images is `[image tag]-[php tag]-[phpstorm tag]-[plugin-tag(s)]`
